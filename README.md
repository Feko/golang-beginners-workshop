##golang workshop
This code was written during **golang for beginners workshop** in September 14, 2019. 
Event held by [Hackerspace Blumenau](https://www.hackerspaceblumenau.org/) community, hosted at [FURB University](https://furb.br) lectured by [Diego Gaulke](https://github.com/diegogaulke)

As a half-day, short-duration event focused on people who had never touched Go before, many interesting topics of Go language (such as Goroutines, Channels, concurrency, and multithreading) weren't visited. Anyway, it was fun :-)

For improved readability, I've split the workshop's code in five parts.
To run the code, use:
`$ go run main.go`

###part1
Basics of Go, package, entrypoint (main()), hello world, variables (int, char, string), short-assignment and declaration, arrays (Immutable), Slices (Same declaration as an Array, but an abstraction of arrays, allowing mutability), and maps.
Also, naming convention... I'm still struggling in naming the variables with just a few letters, instead of intention-revealing names.

###part2
Basic casting, conditionals, loop (For is the only loop), for with range, and pointers (Kinda easy when compared with C-pointers).

###part3
That a small piece of code
It's just functions... A normal one, a function that declares its returning member on signature, and a function returning more than one value.

###part4
Structs, visibility (Hint: the case of first letter matters!), and structs methods.

###part5
Interfaces, and structs implementing interface.
